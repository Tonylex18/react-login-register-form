# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Created this project using npx create-react-app command in the vscode embedded terminal.

This is a simple Login/Register form created using react.

Packages used are the _styled-components_ used for the styling of the site and _framer-motion_ used for the animation you see when you
click on the _Don't have an account? signup_ button and the _Already have an account? signin_ button.

All of the _jsx_ components used can be find in the _components_ folder inside the _src_ folder.
